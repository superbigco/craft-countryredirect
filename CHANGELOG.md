> {warning} You now have to register for a MaxMind account and obtain a license key in order to download the GeoLite2 databases. This is due to a change that was introduced December 30th 2019, [to comply with GDPR and CCPA](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/). After upgrading to 2.1.0, you need to add the license key in the Country Redirect plugin settings to continue downloading the databases. Check the readme for detailed instructions on this.

### Added
- Added setting `dbPath` to override where the plugin stores its database. By default it will now use the storage path instead of the plugin directory. ðŸ’¯ improvement.
